### Hi, lads! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">
I am Szymon Ruciński. I am a Data-science/ Machine-learning student fascinated with endless cloud and AI possibilites. Doing my best to stay competetive and eager to learn new stuff. For me programming is just a tool for executing my high-level ideas. After hours I make YouTube videos, personal projects and of course run or cycle. My goal is to take part in triathlon competition in 2021 🥈🏃‍♂️ 🚴‍♀️
